## Assignment Description
This assignment introduces students to:

- Basic Python programming  
- Writing and running a simple program  
- Proper documentation using a README file  
- Using GitHub for version control  

The task is to create a **Hello World program in Python** and explain everything about it in this README file.

---

## Program Code
The Python program that prints "Hello, World!" is as follows:

```python
# Hello World Program
# Author: Joel Abiodun
# Matric Number: 25/18070
# Department: Computer Science
# Institution: Caleb University

def main():
    print("Hello, World!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

Explanation of the Code
1. Comment Section
# Hello World Program
# Author: Joel Abiodun
# Matric Number: 25/18070


These lines are comments. They provide information about the program and the author.
Comments are ignored by Python during execution.

2. The main() Function
def main():
    print("Hello, World!")


Defines a function named main.

The print() function outputs the message "Hello, World!" to the screen.

Using a function makes the program structured, readable, and maintainable.

3. Program Execution Control
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()


Ensures that main() runs only when the file is executed directly.

Prevents automatic execution if this file is imported into another Python program.

Demonstrates good programming practice.

Output of the Program

When the program is executed, the output is:

Hello, World!

How to Run the Program

Install Python on your computer.

Open a terminal or command prompt.

Navigate to the folder containing this README file.

Run Python interactively, or copy the program into a Python IDE.

Execute the program to see the output:

Hello, World!
