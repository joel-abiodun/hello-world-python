## Assignment Description
This assignment introduces students to:

- Basic Python programming  
- Writing and running a simple program  
- Proper documentation using a README file  
- Using GitHub for version control  

The task is to create a **Hello World program in Python** and explain everything about it in this README file.

## Program Code
The Python program that prints "Hello, World!" is as follows:

```python
# Hello World Program
# Author: Joel Abiodun
# Matric Number: 25/18070
# Department: Computer Science
# Institution: Caleb University

def main():
    print("Hello, World!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

Explanation of the Code
1. Comment Section
# Hello World Program
# Author: Joel Abiodun
# Matric Number: 25/18070


These lines are comments. They provide information about the program and the author.
Comments are ignored by Python during execution.

2. The main() Function
def main():
    print("Hello, World!")


Defines a function named main.

The print() function outputs the message "Hello, World!" to the screen.

Using a function makes the program structured, readable, and maintainable.

3. Program Execution Control
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

# Explanation of the Code

## 1. Comment Section
```python
# Hello World Program
# Author: Joel Abiodun
# Matric Number: 25/18070
These lines are comments that provide information about the program and the author.

Comments are ignored during execution.

2. The main() Function
python
Copy code
def main():
    print("Hello, World!")
Defines a function named main.

The print() statement displays "Hello, World!" on the screen.

Using a function makes the program structured, readable, and maintainable.

3. Program Execution Control
python
Copy code
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
Ensures the main() function runs only when the file is executed directly.

Prevents execution if the file is imported into another Python program.

Demonstrates good programming practice.
